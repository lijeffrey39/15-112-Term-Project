I created a project to create a snowboarding simulation game using the Pymunk physics engine. The game is viewed as a 2d platform game. The slopes in the game are randomly generated by finding random points and creating bezier curves from those points. As the player moves along, the slopes are created using procedural generation. For the collision detection and the graphics, I used Pygame. 

To run the application, install Pygame using this link.

Then install Pymunk from this link.
